After helping run a café in Montana, then owning a smoothie shop in Brandon, we decided we just weren’t cut out for the food business. So, when the opportunity presented itself to start a mobile detailing business, we jumped at the chance.

“We” are Chris and Sandi Showalter. While Sandi takes care of the behind the scenes duties - the ones that allow her to stay cool and dry - Chris is the face (and the sweat) of AutoPros. He’s the one that goes out in the hot, blazing Florida sun and gets your car looking pristine. He thoroughly believes in global warming, as every June through October, he can attest that the earth is only 10 inches from the sun.

While Chris has detailed his own and his family’s cars since he was a teenager, he started doing it professionally in 2010. Since then he has learned a lot, and Sandi gets to hear all about it. In 2015, he became a certified detailer and joined the International Detailers Association (IDA.)

Chris doesn’t like to brag, so Sandi will do it for him. “He is the best detailer around, and I’m not saying that just because he’s my husband and I love him. He really is!”

Here’s a fun fact. Chris is a reincarnated World War II soldier. Not really, but if you mention that to him when he comes to detail your car, he’ll throw in a free Rain-X treatment for showing you took the time to read our About Us page.
